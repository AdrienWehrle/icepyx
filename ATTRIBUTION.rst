Attribution Guidelines
======================

We are extremely grateful to everyone who has contributed to the success of the icepyx community, whether through direct contributions to or feedback about icepyx or as developers or maintainers of complimentary resources that are included within the icepyx ecosystem. This document outlines our goals to give appropriate attribution to all contributors to icepyx in ways that are fair and diverse and supportive of professional goals. To do so, we define broadly *contributions* as:
    Efforts towards achieving icepyx's goals, including writing code, tests, or documentation,
    development of example workflows, development, significant contributions, or maintenance of 
    a tailored package that broadens the functionality of icepyx, feedback and suggestions, 
    community building, etc.
    
We use the terms "contributors", "developers", and "authors" interchangably. We will recognize contributions in the following ways.

Contributors List
-----------------
Anyone who has contributed a pull request to icepyx is welcome to add themselves to the ```CONTRIBUTORS.rst`` <https://github.com/icesat2py/icepyx/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS.rst>`_ file located in the top level directory; the file is packaged and distributed with icepyx. This process is optional, but is the easiest way for us to say "thank you" to everyone who has helped this project.


Example Workflows
-----------------
Many of the example workflows included within icepyx were developed by individuals or small teams for educational or research purposes. We encourage example developers to provide proper recognition for these efforts both within the notebook itself and by adding contributors to the `Contributors List`_ for attribution as describered herein.


Version Release on Zenodo
-------------------------
When new releases of icepyx are archived on Zenodo, anyone who has contributed to icepyx will be invited to be an author. The list of potential authors will be generated using the `Contributors List`. Thus, if you have contributed to icepyx and would like to be included as an author, you *must* add your full name, affiliation ("Unaffiliated" is acceptable), and ORCID (optional) to ``CONTRIBUTORS.rst``.

Author order will be determined based on the number of commits made to the repository (``git shortlog -sne``) and may be modified on an individual-case basis by consensus of the lead development team (Anthony Arendt, Lindsey Heagy, Fernando Perez, Jessica Scheick).

If you do not wish to be included in the author list for Zenodo version releases, please add a note (e.g. "do not include in Zenodo") to your entry.


Scientific Publications (Papers)
--------------------------------

We aim to write academic papers for our software and its uses. Ideally, we will publish on an early version of the software and subsequently on major releases, use cases, or to advance the causes of open-source software and open science. To be eligible for authorship on scientific papers, contributors must:
  1. Contribute to the development (including code, documentation, and examples) of icepyx. Substantial non-code contributions constitute eligibility for authorship.
  2. Add yourself to the `Contributors List`_.
  3. Write, read, and review the manuscript in a timely manner and provide feedback (acknowledgement of review is sufficient, but we'd prefer more).

Author order will be determined by the number of commits since the last major release with an associated paper (``git shortlog vX.0.0...HEAD -sne``) and may be modified to reflect contributions to the writing of the manuscript. Authors with contributions that do not have associated commits will be decided by all authors. Author order may be modified on a case-by-case basis by consensus of the lead development team and top contributors.


Disclaimer: These policies are not permanent or fixed and may change to accomodate community growth, best practices, and feedback.
