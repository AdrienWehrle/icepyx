    "Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. It is the most commonly used language for looking at this kind of data, and the tools used to help with acessing/analyze data (captoolkit/icepyx) are written in python. It is also reccomended to use Anaconda, which is the recommended Python distribution, for installing and working with Python on your local computer. Conda is an open source package and environment management system for installing multiple versions of software packages, their dependencies and switching easily between them. While you can set up python without anaconda, conda makes it easier to install packages such as numpy, pandas, geopandas and other tools used in data analysis. \n",
